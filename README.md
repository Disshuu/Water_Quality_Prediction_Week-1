# 💧 Water Quality Prediction - ML Project

This mini-project applies machine learning to predict water quality based on chemical indicators such as pH, turbidity, hardness, and more. It helps classify water as safe or unsafe, using models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

### 📌 Objective
To build a smart system that assists in identifying the safety of water sources using data-driven methods — promoting AI for environmental sustainability.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)  
- Jupyter Notebook

### 📊 Key Steps
- Data preprocessing & visualization  
- Feature scaling & selection  
- Model training & evaluation  
- Accuracy & classification reporting

### ✅ Output
Predicts whether water is **Safe** or **Not Safe** with visual support and accuracy results.
