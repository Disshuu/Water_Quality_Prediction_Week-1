# 💧 Water Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

This mini-project uses machine learning to predict whether water is safe or unsafe based on various chemical properties. It was implemented entirely in **Google Colab**, making it accessible and easy to run online.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To create a classification model that predicts water quality using real-world environmental data. The project applies ML algorithms to identify safe and unsafe water, supporting clean water initiatives through AI.

## 🔬 Chemical Parameters Used

| Parameter | Significance |
|-----------|---------------|
| NH₄ (Ammonium) | Indicates pollution from sewage & fertilizers |
| BOD₅ | High values show organic pollution, lowers oxygen |
| Suspended Solids | Causes murkiness, harms aquatic life |
| O₂ (Dissolved Oxygen) | Low DO stresses aquatic life |
| NO₃ (Nitrate) | Causes eutrophication & health issues |
| NO₂ (Nitrite) | Toxic at low levels |
| SO₄ (Sulfate) | Affects taste, promotes corrosion |
| PO₄ (Phosphate) | Leads to algal blooms |
| Cl (Chloride) | Affects freshwater ecosystems |
